- ✅ FAQ section - 10 comprehensive Q&As addressing all objections
- ✅ Scaling trend visualization - Larger models benefit 1.5-2× more
- ✅ Training-free badges & callouts - Prominent messaging throughout
- ✅ "VS beats fine-tuning" callout - GPT-4+VS matches Llama fine-tuned
- ✅ Synthetic data performance - Math accuracy 32.8% → 37.5%
- ✅ VS variants comparison table - Clear guidance on when to use each
- ✅ Full integration - All components added to main blog post

#### Day 5: Remaining Tasks
- ⏳ Temperature ablation refinement
- ⏳ Dialogue simulation visualization (optional)
- ⏳ Open-ended QA metrics display (optional)
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Cross-browser testing
- ⏳ Accessibility audit

### Week 3: Polish & Testing (Upcoming)
- User testing with 5+ readers
- Performance optimization (<3s load time)
- SEO optimization
- Mobile experience refinement

### Week 4: Launch (Upcoming)
- Production deployment
- Social media assets
- Launch monitoring
- Follow-up content
